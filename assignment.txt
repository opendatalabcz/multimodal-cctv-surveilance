There are many publicly available live camera feeds that offer valuable monitoring opportunities. In Prague, there is a network of cameras available from bezpecnost.praha.eu which is primarily focused on traffic monitoring. It also monitors famous public places like the Charles Bridge. There are also publicly available livestreams from airports which also contain a lot of valuable information. The large number of these cameras means that continuous human monitoring is not feasible, which calls for an automated approach. This diploma thesis will focus on using multi-modal models to assess current situations in the monitored locations and provide automated interpretation of this information.

The goals of this thesis are:

1. Gather the necessary data for the task, including identifying suitable camera sources and collecting relevant footage.
2. Explore the current state-of-the-art in multi-modal models for video understanding and assess their suitability for surveillance tasks.
3. Select and implement one of the existing multi-modal models that is best suited for the task.
4. Define potential use cases and develop methods to extract relevant information from the camera feeds.
5. Design possible approaches to the problem and select the most promising one.
6. Implement a prototype of the selected approach and evaluate its performance on the gathered data.
7. Draw conclusions and identify future research directions in this area.

Possible use cases are:
- Detecting traffic jams and accidents
- Monitoring overcrowding in public places
- Analyzing weather conditions
- Assessing the situation on an airport apron - refueling, boarding, cargo handling...
- Using this information to assess trends and make predictions
- Connecting this information together for a better understanding of the overall situation
- Anomaly detection
