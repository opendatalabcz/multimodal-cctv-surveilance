There are many publicly available live camera feeds from all sorts of public places. In Prague, there is a network of cameras available from bezpecnost.praha.eu which is mostly focused on traffic monitoring. There are also publicly available livestreams from airports and other possible places of interest. There are a lot of these cameras, so human monitoring is not feasible. This diploma thesis will focus on the usage of multi-modal models to assess the current situations in the monitored places and provide an interpretation of this information.

The goals of this thesis are:

1. Gather the data necessary for the task. This includes finding suitable cameras and gathering the footage.
2. Explore the current state of the art in multi-modal models for video understanding and assess their suitability for the task.
3. Define possible use cases and try to gather as much relevant information from the cameras as possible.
4. Come up with possible approaches to the task and select the most suitable one.
5. Implement a prototype of the selected approach, attempting to connect information from multiple cameras to get a more comprehensive understanding of the situation.
6. Evaluate the prototype on the gathered data and assess its performance.
7. Formulate conclusions and possible future directions for research in this area.
